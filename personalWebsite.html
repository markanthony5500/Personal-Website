        <p>
          Some of my favorite hobbies include spending time with friends, playing competitive games online, and making music. In high school, I dedicated much of my time to practicing trumpet for marching, concert, and jazz band. Outside of school, I enjoy hanging out with friends and family. One of my favorite activities with friends is going to the movies, especially if it's a Marvel film. I have been playing competitive games with a close group of online friends I've known for years. My favorite competitive games include Overwatch 2, Smite, and For Honor.
